Also, research shows that Salicylic Acid has anti-inflammatory properties, making it an ideal solution for relieving inflammation.",
            "Any active ingredient that promotes cell turnover can cause purging in certain people, especially with sensitive or acne-prone skin. It is an entirely natural and normal response to active ingredients. Salicylic acid pushes trapped sebum and oil to the surface, and thus those acnes which were supposed to appear later pop up early. The natural cell-shedding cycle in a healthy young person is 28 days. So, purging usually subsides in 3-4 weeks. It is important to stick with a product during the purging phase. You cannot avoid purging, but there are things you can do to ease it out. The first and most important thing is to take it slow. If you are new to acids, apply 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase your frequency. Avoid prolonged sun exposure and do not touch or pop your acne.",
